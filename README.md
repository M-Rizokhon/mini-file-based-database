# 📁 Simple File-Based Database Engine in C++

A lightweight, console-based database-like application written in C++. This project allows users to create, read, update, and delete text files directly through a terminal interface — simulating basic file-based data management.

## 💡 Overview

This project was created as a way to practice object-oriented programming in C++, file handling, and basic software design. It works like a minimalistic database engine with CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), all managed via terminal commands.
